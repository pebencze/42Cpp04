## Subtype Polymorphism

Subtype polymorphism is very useful when it comes to inheritence. If we would like a function to be overridden in a child class, we have to virtualize that function in the parent class. This way we make the function dynamic during the execution. E.g. the Animal Cat won't make an animal sound, but it will execute the makeSound function of its own class.

```c++
class Animal {
    public:
        ...
        virtual ~Animal();
        
        virtual void makeSound() const; //dynamic function or virtual member function (that will be overridden)
        ...
};

class Cat : public Animal {
    public:
        Cat();
        Cat(const Cat & other);
        Cat & operator=(const Cat & other);
        ~Cat();

        void makeSound() const;
};

```

## Deep vs. Shallow Copies
A shallow copy duplicates an object's memory address, not the actual data it points to. This means that the original and the copy point to the same memory location. While shallow copying is fast, it can lead to issues such as dangling pointers, memory leaks, and unintended data modification if not used carefully. A deep copy allocates memory and duplicates the data that the object points to. This is why a custom copy constructor and assigment operator are useful.

```c++
class Cat : public Animal {
    public:
        ...
    private:
        Brain *brain;
};

Cat & Cat::operator=(const Cat & other){
    if (this != &other){
        this->_type = other._type;
        this->brain = new Brain(); //DEEP COPY
        *(this->brain) = *(other.brain); //DEEP COPY
    }
    return *this;
}

WrongCat & WrongCat::operator=(const WrongCat & other){
    if (this != &other){
        this->_type = other._type;
        this->brain = other.brain; //SHALLOW COPY
    }
    return *this;
}
```

## Abstract Classes
Sometimes implementation of all functions cannot be provided in a base class because we donâ€™t know the implementation, e.g. all animals move, but there is no general move function. Such a class is called an abstract class, having the syntax of **AClass**
A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we can have an implementation, But we must override that function in the derived class, otherwise, the derived class will also become an abstract class. A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in the declaration.

```c++
//correct:
virtual void makeSound() const = 0;

//wrong:
void makeSound() const = 0;
error: 'makeSound' is not virtual and cannot be declared pure

//children classes have to have the implementation of the pure virtual methods,
//otherwise they become abstract as well
./AAnimal.hpp:25:22: note: unimplemented pure virtual method 'makeSound' in 'Cat'
        virtual void makeSound() const = 0;
```
